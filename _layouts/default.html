                When America chooses its leader, the whole world holds its breath. Calling it a mere national voting process would be an understatement; 
                it is a sacred geopolitical ritual whose consequences are felt across the globe, from Asian stock markets to European frontlines. 

            <p>
                The American presidential election is a quadrennial marathon punctuated by key milestones: the primaries, the national conventions, and the final race between Democrats and Republicans, a duopoly that splits the nation in two distinct colors:

            </p>
            <p>
                *The Democratic Party (Blue): Generally representing liberal, progressive values.
                *The Republican Party (Red): Generally representing conservative, traditionalist values. 

            </p>
            <p>
                In this context, it is natural to wonder whether an alignment between political
                decisions and people's behaviour has been achieved. Have people felt that their
                leaders need to be more in touch with their concerns and are unable to address
                the challenges at hand effectively? Has the COVID-19 pandemic, with its
                restrictions on daily life, sparked a renewed interest in politics among the
                population? As we examine this dynamic, it is also important to consider the
                role of the leading political party. Have they received support from the
                population, or have they faced disapproval for their actions or lack thereof?

            <p>
                The COVID-19 pandemic brought unprecedented restrictions on mobility, forcing people to stay at home
                and go out only when necessary. But as the population adjusted to this new reality, a question
                lingered in the minds of many: who decided to reduce mobility? Was it the government responding
                to the crisis to slow the spread of the virus? Or were there other forces at play, shaping the
                decisions being made and dictating the course of the pandemic? The mobility data reveals an
                influence between the governments of European countries managing the crisis and their populations
                regarding reduced mobility. How European governments and populations responded to the COVID-19 crisis
                had a noticeable impact on mobility behaviour.

                The graph below depicts the changes in mobility over time (don't forget to slide!).

                When the first deaths from COVID-19 occurred in countries such as France, Spain, and Norway,
                there was little change in mobility. This may be because COVID-19 was still relatively unknown in Europe
                then.
                However, as the virus spread more widely and began causing more deaths, particularly in countries like
                Italy,
                the interest in COVID-19 increased. This was reflected in the evolution of COVID-related pageviews over
                time.
                In Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Sweden, the first deaths were accompanied by reduced mobility
                and increased
                interest in COVID-19. In Denmark and Finland, where the first deaths occurred later, and events had
                already
                influenced the interest in COVID-19 in other countries, the increased interest in the virus likely
                explained the
                reduction in mobility.
            </p>
            <p>
                Regarding what governments did concerning mobility behaviour, lockdown measures were often implemented
                once the
                decline in mobility had stabilised. This suggests that the government's restrictions on mobility came
                after the
                population had already decided to reduce their mobility. This may reflect a need for governments to be
                more
                responsive to the needs and concerns of their citizens.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the COVID-19 pandemic swept across the globe, governments worldwide faced the daunting task of trying
                to ease
                the burden on hospitals and protect their populations. To this end, many governments implemented various
                measures,
                including confinement, school closures, and mask mandates.
            </p>
            <p>
                But as the crisis wore on, it became clear that not all countries were acting similarly. Some countries
                were
                more aggressive in their efforts to control the spread of the virus, while others were laxer in their
                approach.
                This raised the question: are there countries that acted similarly, or were they taking a unique
                approach to the crisis?
            </p>

        <section id="grouping">
            <h2> Is it possible to group countries based on their reaction time to the crisis? </h2>
            <p>
                The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed a wide range of differences in how countries have responded to the
                crisis.
                By analysing each country's reaction time – the length of time it took for the first measures to be
                imposed
                after the first case was detected – and the duration of mobility restrictions, we can try to group
                countries
                into clusters based on their response to the pandemic.
            </p>
            <p>
                One group of countries that stands out is the "big European economies" – France, Germany, and Italy –
                which
                took a long time to react to COVID-19 and ended up imposing long periods of reduced mobility. These
                countries
                may have hesitated to take drastic measures due to concerns about the economy or the challenges of
                enforcing
                measures over a large population.
                On the other hand, we see smaller, highly developed European countries like Denmark,
                the Netherlands, and Norway, which reacted quickly to COVID-19 and had shorter periods of reduced
                mobility.
                Another group of countries, including Finland, Japan, and Sweden, took longer to respond to the crisis
                but imposed shorter periods of reduced mobility.
                Finally, some countries like Serbia and South Korea had relatively short periods of reduced mobility
                compared to other countries.
            </p>
            <p>The graph illustrates the grouping of countries based on their reaction time and duration of reduced
                mobility.</p>
            <img class="plot--img" src="/ada-vnboys-website/assets/img/redused_Mobility_VS_Response_Time.png"
                alt="Mobility">
            <p>
                Spain is an outlier in this analysis, as it took a longer-than-average time to react to the crisis and
                has an
                undefined duration of reduced mobility, as there had not yet been an exact date for the return to normal
                levels.
                It seems likely that Spain's reduced mobility period was lengthy, similar to the other countries in
                group
                1 – the “big European economies” of France, Germany, and Italy – which also had long response times and
                extended periods of reduced mobility. We thus assume that Spain is part of group 1.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the different groups of European countries in mind, it is worth examining how the COVID-19 pandemic
                and the decisions made in response to it have affected people's interest in politics. Have the
                restrictions
                on daily life and the measures taken to address the crisis sparked a renewed interest in political
                engagement
                among the population, or have they led to disengagement and disillusionment with the political process?
                By
                exploring these questions, we can gain a better understanding of how the pandemic has shaped people's
                attitudes towards politics and the role it plays in their lives.

            <h2>Has the COVID-19 pandemic increased people's interest in politics?</h2>
            <p>
                The Coronawiki dataset provides pageview data for various topics on Wikipedia over time, allowing us
                to track the evolution of interest in COVID-19 and politics during the pandemic. By examining the number
                of pageviews for these topics, we can gauge the level of interest and see how different stages of the
                pandemic have impacted it.
            </p>
            <p>
                For four major European countries, we see that the rapid growth in interest in COVID-19 occurred
                around the time the first case of the virus was discovered in the country. This growth is steepest
                at the time of the first death or shortly thereafter, indicating that the news of mortality was a major
                driving force for increased interest. We also observe a peak in interest in COVID-19 in all four
                countries
                shortly after the beginning of abnormal mobility, coinciding with the implementation of lockdowns and
                other
                strict measures. As people's lives were disrupted and they had to adapt to a new way of living, interest
                in
                COVID-19 peaked.
            </p>
            <p>There appeared to be no direct effect on the interest in politics when COVID-19 first appeared in these
                countries.
                However, we see a rise in interest in politics when mobility becomes abnormal, coinciding with
                significant decisions
                taken by governments to impose measures on the population. In addition, as people's mobility is
                affected, they may
                have more time to read up on politics, increasing political interest and awareness.

            <p>
                In smaller European countries that reacted quickly to COVID-19, we see a different trend in interest in
                COVID-19.
                The explosive growth in interest begins before there are even any cases of the virus in the country,
                which may be
                due to these countries closely monitoring the situation in the major European countries and being
                concerned about
                COVID-19 before it appeared in their own country. As a result, their governments quickly addressed
                citizens' concerns.
                These countries also show similar trends in interest in politics, with the first cases corresponding to
                the beginning
                of a rise in interest. However, unlike in the major European countries, interest in politics falls soon
                after mobility
                returns to normal.

                In the countries of group 3, measures to address COVID-19 were implemented relatively late after the
                virus arrived.
                Unlike the other two groups, the exponential growth in interest in COVID-19 had not yet begun when the
                first cases were
                discovered. The explosion in interest occurred roughly a week later in Finland, but in Sweden, it
                occurred approximately
                a month later, once mobility had begun to be affected. Sweden initially had very lax restrictions during
                the pandemic,
                and interest in COVID-19 did not initially surge. People only became interested in COVID-19 when
                restrictions started to
                impact their lives.

            <p>
                The arrival of COVID-19 did not significantly affect interest in politics in these countries, although
                some may have objected
                to the government's slow response. However, the populations in these countries were generally pleased
                with the initial response,
                as the ruling parties saw a boost in popularity. Interest in politics rose as measures were implemented
                and mobility became
                affected, but it quickly fell once mobility returned to normal.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now that we have examined how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected interest in politics and how different
                countries responded
                to the crisis, we can turn to whether the population tended to support or disapprove of the leading
                political parties during
                this time. To answer this question, we can use polling data to see how people's views on the parties
                changed throughout the
                pandemic. This will help us understand whether the decisions made by the government were met with
                approval or backlash and
                how these views may have been influenced by the impact of the pandemic on people's lives and the
                measures taken to address it.

            <h2>How did people's opinions of political parties change in response to COVID-19 interventions?</h2>
            <p>
                As we look at how the COVID-19 pandemic affected political opinions in different countries, we see
                that the populations in <span>group 1</span> (large economies) had varied reactions. In Germany, there
                was a sharp
                rise in popularity for the ruling party, which may indicate support for their efforts to maintain
                stability and implement sanitary measures. In Spain, the main opposition party saw an increase in
                popularity. In Italy, a continual decrease in support for the main party in government began before
                the pandemic, suggesting that domestic issues were more influential on the party's popularity than the
                pandemic itself.

            <p>The following is the result of the polling for group 1 countries.</p>

            <p>
                In contrast, the populations in group 2 (smaller countries where the government reacted quickly) all
                experienced sharp
                increases in support for the government. In Norway, the ruling party's steady decrease in popularity was
                almost entirely
                reversed, indicating that the population highly valued stability and appreciated the quick response of
                their government.

                In group 3, we also see an increase in support for the government. It appears that, in smaller
                countries, governments
                saw an increase in support at the start of the pandemic.

                To gather evidence to support our hypothesis, we conducted t-tests to see if there were statistically
                significant differences in the
                polling of ruling parties before and after the start of the pandemic in the smaller countries. We found
                statistically
                significant differences in the polling of the main ruling parties immediately before and after the
                pandemic's start.
                This allows us to reject the null hypothesis that no such difference exists.

                In times of crisis, it is common for people to rally around their leaders and offer support as they
                navigate the challenges.
                This is often due to a desire for stability and a belief that the government is best equipped to handle
                the crisis. In such
                times, people may be more forgiving of any mistakes or missteps previously made by the government, as
                they understand that
                addressing a crisis is not always straightforward and that leaders are doing their best to protect the
                population.
                Any potential change of leadership process would introduce another challenge to an already burdened
                government.
                Additionally, during a crisis, people may be more willing to comply with the measures implemented by the
                government as
                they understand that such measures are necessary to protect public health and safety. As a result, we
                often see an increase
                in support for the government during times of crisis. This is the case in the smaller countries in our
                study, where governments
                saw an increase in support at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Have the COVID-19 pandemic and the decisions made by governments impacted people's views of politics and
                political
                parties? Our analysis has shown that in some cases, the actions of governments did not align with the
                reactions
                of their population, mainly regarding mobility reduction. We also identified different groups of
                countries based
                on their response to the pandemic, which may be influenced by factors such as population size and the
                severity of
                the crisis. The pandemic also sparked an increased interest in politics as people sought to understand
                the decisions
                being made by their governments and how they would be affected. Additionally, we found that people tend
                to support
                their ruling political parties during times of crisis, as they look to their leaders for stability and
                guidance.
                Further research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on
                political opinions
                and behaviours.
            </p>
            <h3>Further Work</h3>
            <p>
                As the COVID-19 pandemic significantly altered people's views and behaviours, it raises the question of
                whether these
                changes will persist in the long term. Will the population continue to align with political decisions,
                or will there
                be shifts in attitudes and actions as the crisis evolves and becomes resolved? Examining this question
                through a
                study over a longer duration and through each wave of the pandemic could provide valuable insights into
                the ways
                in which the population may respond to political decisions and events in the future. Understanding the
                lasting
                effects of the pandemic on politics will be important for predicting and navigating the changing
                landscape of the
                political sphere.
